## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email your findings to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL] with the subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability in Civil-War-General`
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential mitigations or workarounds
   - Your name/handle for credit (optional)

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days
- We will keep you informed about the progress toward fixing the vulnerability
- We will credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not take legal action against you if you:
  - Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
  - Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
  - Give us reasonable time to address the issue before making any information public

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**:
   - Regularly update your project dependencies using:
     ```bash
     mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
     ```

2. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure configuration management

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Always validate and sanitize user input
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Security**:
   - Regularly check for vulnerable dependencies using:
     ```bash
     mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
     ```
   - Review and update the OWASP dependency-check configuration in `pom.xml`

2. **Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Follow the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference/)
   - Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
   - Use secure random number generation for any security-sensitive operations

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms if applicable
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Validate all user inputs and outputs

4. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2) if handling passwords

## Known Security Considerations

1. **File Operations**:
   - The application reads order configurations from JSON files
   - Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration files
   - Validate all input files against a strict schema

2. **Network Security**:
   - If network features are added, always use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper CORS policies if exposing web services

3. **Logging**:
   - Avoid logging sensitive information
   - Implement proper log rotation and retention policies

## Security Tools and Plugins

We recommend using the following security tools:

1. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - OWASP Dependency-Check Maven Plugin
   - Snyk

2. **Static Analysis**:
   - SpotBugs with Find Security Bugs plugin
   - SonarQube with security rules enabled

3. **Dynamic Analysis**:
   - OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
   - Burp Suite Community Edition

## Security Updates and Patching

We are committed to:
- Promptly addressing reported security vulnerabilities
- Releasing security patches in a timely manner
- Maintaining clear communication with security researchers
- Providing credit to security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities
